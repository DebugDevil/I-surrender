# I-surrender
OK, OK, Don't shoot - I give up!

## About: ##

I Surrender is a GTA V (ScripthookV.Net) script allowing you to surrender to police when wanted. 
You can either give up to the police without them shooting you or just clear your wanted level altogether (you cheater). 

A list of potential keybindings can be found: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=netframework-4.8 or to disable a binding (e.g. the clear wanted option) set it to None. Modifiers allowing key combinations can be set to Alt, Control, Shift or None.

Controller support available using a combination of buttons which can be disabled by setting to Noone. 

## Features: ##
