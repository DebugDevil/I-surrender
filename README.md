# I-surrender
OK, OK, Don't shoot - I give up!

**About:** 

I Surrender is a GTA V (ScripthookV.Net) script allowing you to surrender to police when wanted. 

You can either give up to the police without them shooting you or just clear your wanted level altogether (you cheater). 

A list of potential keybindings can be found: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=netframework-4.8 or to disable a binding (e.g. the modifier key) set it to None

**Current limitations:**

- Cannot cancel once you have initiated the "give up" until you are busted. 
- Currently controller is not supported (learning how to do this in ScripthookV so should be possible soon)

**Installation:**

1. Ensure you have the latest version of ScripthookV and Scripthookv.Net installed correctly.
2. Copy the scripts folder into your "Grand Theft Auto V" install folder
3. Edit the .ini to meet your requirements
