# I-surrender
OK, OK, Don't shoot - I give up!

**About:** 

I Surrender is a GTA V (ScripthookV.Net) script allowing you to surrender to police when wanted. 
You can either give up to the police without them shooting you or just clear your wanted level altogether (you cheater). 

A list of potential keybindings can be found: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=netframework-4.8 or to disable a binding (e.g. the clear wanted option) set it to None.
Modifiers allowing key combinations can be set to Alt, Control, Shift or None.

**Features:**

- Surrender by putting hands up until "Busted"
- Wanted level kept at 1 star to prevent agressive cops while surrendering
- Cancel and try to keep running (still busted if they catch you)
- (If enabled) Cheat and clear your wanted level
- Option to drop weapon in hand on surrendering (gun may misfire when hitting ground)

**Current limitations or known issues:**

- Currently controller is not supported (planned in future)

**Installation:**

1. Ensure you have the latest version of ScripthookV and Scripthookv.Net installed correctly.
